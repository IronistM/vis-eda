# Visualisation for EDA

This repo contains the [slides](vis-eda.pdf) and code for my [OpenVisConf](https://openvisconf.com) talk, 2017-04-25.

The code isn't fully reproducible because you won't be able to authenticate to my GitHub or TripIt accounts, but you should be able to read it to understand how it works, and you should be able to adapt it to work with your own data.
